Problem: Given a number, check whether it is an even number or an odd number.

Input: 5 
output: Odd

Input: 6 
Output: Even

Algorithm 1: Divisibility by 2

1.Get the input number
2.Find the remainder of the number when divided by 2
3.If the remainder is 0, then the number is even
4.If the remainder is 1, then the number is odd

Algorithm 2 : Last Digit

1.Get the input number 
2.Find the last digit of the number
3.Check if the last digit is 0,2,4,6,8 then the number is even
4.Else if the last digit is 1,3,5,7,9 then the number is odd
